# Computer-Architecture

This course project has to be done individually.
In this course project, you will be asked to use the SimpleScalar “sim-outorder” model and the SPEC 2000 benchmark suite to evaluate the performance impact of a number of basic cache configuration parameters, such as the L1 and L2 cache size, associativity, block size, and so on.
